 The time it took you to perform the exercise

The time that it me took to perfom the exercise was around 3h aproximately.

- The parts that were difficult for you and why

The most difficult part for me was be make a good position to camera, to play well and see the game in good vision.

- The parts you think you could do better and how

The parts that I think that could do better is have more graphic design and mechanics.

- What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

I would do more mechanics like fly only if I touched the screen , swim with similar mechanic, and make it in space
too.

- What did you think

When i recieved the email i said: ok, i know what game is it but i go to taste it and i go to see what mechanics it have. 
I was playing around 10-15 min to see the game and decide what type, mechanichs and camera i will did.

- Any comment you may have

I really like this test to improve my skills and decitions.  The test was  little harder with only 5hours 
to make a basic mechanic and mini videogame with "no-time" but i'm really happy with the result :).
